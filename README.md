# ATM-simulator
Project Title: Console-Based ATM Simulator in Java

Objective:
To simulate the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using a Java console application, allowing users to perform banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system.

Project Description:
This project is a menu-driven console-based program that imitates an ATM system. It allows a user to interact through the console using numeric input options.
The system simulates a single-user ATM experience where the user:

Logs in using a predefined PIN or account number.
Views account balance.
Deposits money into the account.
Withdraws money (if sufficient balance is available).
Exits safely from the system.
The purpose is to understand and implement basic control structures, loops, methods, and conditional statements in Java.
